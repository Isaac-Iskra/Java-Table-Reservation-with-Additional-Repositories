# Java-Table-Reservation-with-Additional-Repositories
A code sample that demonstrates a Table Reservation system that has Repositories added to it.

The code above demonstrates how to add additional repositories to an existing table reservation project in Java. The code includes the creation of a new interface called AdditionalRepository with a method called getReservationsForDate() that takes a LocalDate parameter and returns a list of reservations for that date.

An implementation of the AdditionalRepository interface is also created. This implementation is called AdditionalRepositoryImpl and includes an ArrayList to store reservations. The getReservationsForDate() method in this class iterates through the reservations and adds any reservations that match the given date to a new list, which is then returned.

A new entity object called AdditionalEntity is also created, which takes an instance of the AdditionalRepository interface in its constructor and provides a method called getReservationsForDate() that uses the getReservationsForDate() method of the repository to retrieve reservations for a specific date.

Finally, the existing Reservation entity is modified to include a new static method called getReservationsForDate() that takes an instance of the AdditionalRepository interface and a date as input. This method uses the AdditionalEntity object to retrieve reservations for the given date using the getReservationsForDate() method and returns the result.

Together, these code snippets demonstrate how to add additional functionality to an existing project by creating new interfaces, implementations, and entities that can interact with those interfaces. Specifically, the code demonstrates how to add the ability to retrieve reservations for a specific date to an existing table reservation project.
